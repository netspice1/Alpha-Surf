Alpha-Surf
==========

Letter-based tabigating extension for Chrome
(not completed)

This is a half-baked Chrome extension/idea I made while I had a non-functional wrist for a while.  It's certainly not complete, but perhaps it's a useful idea for someone.

Usage Example
=============

Hold down 'X' key to activate Alpha-Surf, and then hit 'b' key repeatedly to 'tab' through all links in a page that begin with 'b' or 'B'.
